# Project Title

Water Filling Machine using Flow Sensor & Arduino

# Overview 

In this project, we will build a Water Filling Machine using Flow Sensor & Arduino. The user inputs the total quantity of liquid using a 4Ã—4 Keypad. The pump draws the exact quantity of water after receiving the user input. When an exact quantity is fulfilled, the pump disconnects automatically and stops further drawing of liquid. The maximum amount of liquid is up to 1500ml only.

# Uses

Automatic Bottle Filling Machines are most commonly used in the beverages and soft drink industries. The project can be used in measuring the quantity of water, petrol, milk, drinks, and any other liquid based on user input. A better advancement of the project could be making a prepaid Liquid Dispenser Machine or a Conveyer based water filling system.
